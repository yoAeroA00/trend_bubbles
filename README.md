## Trend Bubbles

*Github do not allow uploading big files. So, I was unable to upload the Sentiment Model but as a substitute Please, use the following Model;

    git clone https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/xlm-twitter-politics-sentiment/

Copy this model to data\sentiment_model directory.

At last run,

    streamlit run Home.py
